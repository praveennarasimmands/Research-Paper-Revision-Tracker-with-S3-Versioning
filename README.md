# **Research Paper Revision Tracker with S3 Versioning**

## **Domain**: Research & Academia

### **Problem Statement**
In research, papers, datasets, and presentations are frequently revised and updated. Keeping track of these changes is essential for maintaining research integrity, meeting publication requirements, and facilitating peer review. Without proper version control, there is a risk of losing earlier drafts and failing to track the evolution of the research.

### **Challenges**
- **Difficulty Tracking Changes**: Keeping track of changes in research papers and datasets can be time-consuming and error-prone.
- **Risk of Losing Data**: Without versioning, earlier drafts or important revisions may be accidentally lost.
- **Lack of Easy Access to Previous Drafts**: Researchers need a system to access earlier versions for review and comparisons during the peer review process.

### **Solution Overview**
Implement **S3 Versioning** to manage and store different versions of research papers, datasets, and presentations. This will ensure that no revisions are lost, and the entire history of the research process can be accessed and compared easily.

### **How It Solves the Problem**
By utilizing S3 Versioning, each revision of the research paper, dataset, or presentation is automatically saved, making it easy to retrieve past versions, compare changes, and ensure the integrity of the research over time.

## **How We Will Solve the Problems**

1. **Enable S3 Versioning for Research Materials**: All research files, including papers and datasets, will be stored in an S3 bucket with versioning enabled, ensuring that each change is tracked and recorded.
2. **Build a User-Friendly Interface for Revision Management**: Create a web interface that allows researchers to review, compare, and track different versions of their research materials easily.
3. **Integrate Peer Review Features**: Allow for seamless integration with peer review platforms, enabling authors to submit and track their papers through the review process.

## **Features**
- **Version Control for Research Files**: Automatically track and store different versions of papers, datasets, and presentations.
- **Metadata Tracking**: Store important metadata, such as author information, change logs, submission statuses, and revision dates.
- **Version Comparison Tools**: Provide researchers with tools to compare different versions and track the evolution of their research over time.
- **Peer Review Integration**: Allow easy submission of papers for peer review, and track comments and revisions from reviewers.

## **How It Works**

1. **Upload Research Materials to S3**: Store all research-related files (papers, datasets, presentations) in an S3 bucket with versioning enabled.
2. **Track Revisions**: Every time a change is made to a file, it is saved as a new version. Researchers can easily access and manage these versions.
3. **Compare and Review Versions**: A simple interface allows users to view changes between different versions of their research materials, ensuring clarity and transparency during the revision process.

## **Implementation Steps**

### **Step 1: Set Up S3 Versioning**
Enable versioning for the S3 bucket where research files will be stored using the `enable_versioning.py` script.

```bash
python enable_versioning.py
```

### **Step 2: Upload Research Files**
Upload research papers, datasets, or presentations to the S3 bucket using the `upload_research_file.py` script. Each update will automatically create a new version.

```bash
python upload_research_file.py
```

### **Step 3: List Versions**
Use the `list_versions.py` script to view all available versions of a specific research document or dataset.

```bash
python list_versions.py
```

### **Step 4: Compare Versions**
Utilize the `compare_versions.py` script to compare two versions of a research document or dataset and review the changes made.

```bash
python compare_versions.py
```

## **Versioning Pipeline Development**

1. **Enable Versioning for Research Files**: Ensure that S3 versioning is enabled for all files stored in the system. This will provide an automated method to track every change made to a research document.
2. **Version Comparison and Review Interface**: Develop a web interface to compare different versions of the research materials, view changes, and track the history of revisions.
3. **Metadata and Submission Tracking**: Store essential metadata for each research document, including author information, submission status, and revision dates.
4. **Collaborating with Praveen**: Work closely with Praveen to ensure the versioning pipeline integrates seamlessly with peer review platforms and research collaboration tools, optimizing the research workflow.

## **Further Improvements**
- **Collaboration Tools**: Enable real-time collaboration on research documents for multiple authors, enhancing team productivity.
- **Integration with Citation Management Systems**: Integrate with tools like Zotero or EndNote to manage citations and references in research papers.
- **Automated Citation Tracking**: Automatically track citations in papers and provide tools for citation formatting and management.
